    <h2>Laura's Tell All</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! This is my first blog post and I am so excited to be preaching today about how my bellybutton became <strong>too deep</strong>.</p>
    <p>Here are some reasons why I love having a deep bellybutton</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a symbol of my all over depth</li>
            <li>It is an indicator that I am the opposite of Kyle XY</li>
            <li>It means I am skinnier than those with shallow bellybuttons</li>
        </ul>
